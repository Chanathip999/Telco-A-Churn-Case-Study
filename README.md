# Telco Customer Churn – Case Study

This is a case study I worked through to better understand customer churn prediction using real-world telecom data.

It explores customer behavior and builds a simple machine learning model using Python, pandas, and scikit-learn.

You're welcome to explore, reuse, or build on this project – whether you're learning, reviewing my work, or working on something similar yourself.


## Key Findings

- Customers with month-to-month contracts and no internet service are more likely to churn.
- Long-term contracts and fiber optic internet are associated with lower churn risk.
- Senior citizens and customers with higher monthly charges show a slightly higher churn rate.
